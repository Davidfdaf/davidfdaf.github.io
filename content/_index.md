My name is David Fitzpatrick. I am a first year masters student at Cornell studying Financial Engineering and Financial Data Science. 
I am interested in every type of data science project I've ever seen. 

I previously worked as a data scientist at the University of Maine. There I worked with a family studies researcher who wanted to examine coparenting survey data to find internal structure. My main tasks were performing gaussian mixture modeling to look for types of coparenting couples, idenitfying data efficient forms of dimensional reduction while preserving interpretabiity, and looking for the characteristics from the family studies literature that were most predictive of couple satisfaction.

I loved economics since high school. Micro economics makes me feel connected to the people around me as I learn about the biases we suffer from and the unexpected effects of individual agents in larger systems. Macro economics allows me to explore the largest systems built by human kind and learn about the the emergant effects from when the decisions of millions of people are aggregated.


I am now exploring financial applications of data science. Since obtaining my undergraduate degree in 2020 I have been exploring these projects on my own(see github link). I am now pursuring a career that fulfills my need to build things with my want to learn using the data I can collect and the statistics and mathematics I've learned and continue to learn.
